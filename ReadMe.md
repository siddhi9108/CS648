# CS648 — Assignment 1: Vecta Corporation

Welcome! This repo contains a very simple **static HTML** page built from the provided `home.txt` content.

> **Goal:** Create an `index.html` that displays the Vecta Corporation text. The first line is an `<h1>`, and **everything else** is wrapped inside **one** `<p>` element.

---

## About this page
- One HTML file: `index.html`
- No frameworks, no external CSS/JS — just pure HTML5.
- Content comes from `home.txt`:
  - **Welcome** headline → `<h1>`
  - Remaining text → one big `<p>` block

## How to view
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser (double–click it or drag it into a browser window).

## What’s inside
```
/
├─ index.html   # the web page
└─ README.md    # this file
```

## Notes
- The page uses the HTML5 doc type and meta tags for UTF‑8 + responsive layout.
- You can edit the `<title>` in the `<head>` to anything you like.

## Markdown sampler (just for fun)
Here are a few Markdown features used in this README:

- **Bold**, _italic_, and `inline code`
- An ordered list:
  1. Open the project
  2. Edit `index.html`
  3. Save & refresh
